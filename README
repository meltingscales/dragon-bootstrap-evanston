Below are resources related to quitting addictive substances. There is much clinical evidence that shows that psychedelic medicines like Ketamine, Psilocybin, Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and Ibogaine can help you quit amphetamine/opioid/alkaloid-type drugs.

Warning: I am personally biased, towards psychedelics. Take this with a grain of salt and follow what doctors tell you.

Do NOT mix alcohol or opioids with Ketamine, and don't take Ibogaine/Iboga shrub if you have heart issues. Other psychedelic medicines should not hurt you. Make sure you're in a safe environment with a person to watch over you if you do take psychedelics.

There are many clinical trials around the country that allow you to receive psychedelics specifically to heal drug addiction or mental disorders. The website [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ (click me)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) can be used to search for specific disorders/addictions/psychedelic medicines.
